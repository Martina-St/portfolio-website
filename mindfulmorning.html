        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>Mindful Morning is an alarm clock app with a special feature that encourages the user to start the day in a conscious and observant way. Besides the design for the UI, I also did user tests and designed the images.</p>

        <h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
        <p>Two factors influenced me to create this app:

          I wasn’t happy with the UX of the pre-installed alarm clock on my phone. Naturally, I thought about how I would improve it. Therefore I found it an interesting project to design my own alarm clock with a more satisfying UX.
          I also became aware of how common it was amongst my peers to browse on social media as the first thing we do after waking up. At that time, I tried to come up with a more satisfying morning routine that sets you up for a productive day.
          I figured I could combine these two ideas. The result was an alarm clock app that also offers the user the option to choose a routine to start the day in a more conscious and mindful way. </p>

        <h2>User Flow Diagram</h2>
        <p>After defining the objectives of the app, I set up the user flow diagram. The objectives were: Make users aware of their behaviour in the morning; Provide users with options to start the day in a more conscious way; Give users an
          alternative to browsing on social media in the morning; Create awareness about what kind of morning routine will set you up for a productive day.</p>

        <h2>Approache</h2>
        <p>Since I wanted to design the app for iOS and Android, the first step I took was to determine the core differences between the UI elements of these platformes. I included them in the design of my mid fidelity frames. </p>

        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>I applied the images in different sizes so that the user would also have a visual connection to every routine.</p>

        <h2>User Testing and Iterations 1</h2>
        <p>After designing high fidelity frames, I created a prototype for the iOS and the Android version of the app via inVision. I then chose testers who are familiar with the respective system and gave them several tasks to complete.
          With the feedback from the testers at hand, I made the following changes to the design:
          My testers expressed that they expected to see what kind of social media they would be able to block.

          I then also changed the makeup of this page to make it better distinguishable from the Social Media Blocker info page.</p>

        <h2>User Testing and Iterations 2</h2>
        <p>In the first version, the “Select” Button from a routine info page would bring you to the general Alarm Set up page with (in this case) “Set Daily Alarm” being pre-selected. After testers were confused by this, I changed the Alarm Set up
          page in case users would come straight from a routine info page.</p>

        <h2>Final Design</h2>
        <p>I incorporated all the findings from the user test into the final design. The result is an easy to operate user interface with a clear structure and flow.</p>
